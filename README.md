## This repository is dedicated wholly to my study of data structure and algorithm

## Codes in explanation files will be written in javascript for simplicity. 

If you have decided to tread the career path of a software developer, you would have to become familiar 
with terms such as time complexity, space complexity, big O, binary search tree, dynamic programming, etc... 

No matter whether you are a junior or senior developer, there will always be a chance that you will given a data structure and algorithm question in today's interview, especially with the big tech companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon... Although this approach towards technical interview has been the hot topic of discussion, I have heard smaller tech companies've also started to adapt it into their own recruiting process. 

Though some of you, in fact, a lot of you, may be against this hiring approach, many other that I have talked / listened to, has raised their own thoughts about the benefits of learning data structure and algorithm. 

## I think it is true.

Data structure and algorithm questions are designed in such ways that force one to think outside of the box to come up with different approaches to technical problems. 

Some solutions may be faster but require more space and vice versa. 

## "Why is this approach better? Has it been optimized?"
 
These types of question also come up in real world application. Thus, being able to reason critically and analytically about a smaller problem, the programmer will be able to improve his decision making ability when it comes to designing optimal solution to real world products, that are used by millions of users. 

## That is why I create this repository. Not just for myself, but for everyone who wants to improve their data structure and algorithm game and critical thinking.
